### Configuration steps:

In order for the package to work, you will need to fund your wallet.

The wallet is created automatically by the package, and to fund it you can follow the steps below:

1. Go to the [Logs](http://my.dappnode/#/packages/ethereum-optimism.public.dappnode.eth/logs) of the package and select the "Fraud Prover" service. You should see a message with your wallet's address:
"Not enough balance in wallet `0x123ABC...` Please, obtain some KovanETH in this faucet: https://kovan.faucet.enjin.io/ or ask in gitter https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet"

2. Copy the wallet's address and visit [this faucet](https://kovan.faucet.enjin.io/) or [this gitter server](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet).

3. Once the wallet has been funded, the package will detect it automatically and will start the verification and proving of the Optimism testnet!

You are ready!
